useRef:

1. For accessing the DOM elements
2. For creating mutable variable which will not re-render the component

For hiding and showing password - we can do this using useRef

what is the best way to handle form data useRef or use state?

if we have 5 to 6 fields then use State, else use Ref.
For performance issues fixing we should use useRef instead of useState

CustomHooks: For creating Reusable function. Custom hooks are our own hooks that we create for our own use
and we can use them multiple times in your project.

Authentication:

We use JSON Web Token to authenticate users.

JWT: JWT stands for JSON Web Token. JWT is used to securely transfer information between two parties like front end and backend.
When user successfully register or login we get JSON Web Token(it is like a security card for accessing protected API Data).
When user access for data, which is only accessible by logged in user then server check the security card which is JSON web token 
and validate it with JWT secret key and that key verified then server return the data to the user.

Debouncing - Debouncing is a method to delay the execution of a function until after a certain amount of time has passed.

Deployment: We configure Database on cloud as cloud database, so everyone can access it
Connect Database(using mongo db) to node js 

GitHub: Github allows developers to create repositories or "repos" where they can store their code and track changes over time.
